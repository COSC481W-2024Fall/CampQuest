## Meet The Team: Team Camping App
### [William Dalian](https://github.com/wildal99) - Team Lead
I am in my second semester as a computer science masters student at Eastern Michigan University. I enjoy both the outdoors and building solutions with technology and look forward to working on this project which will combine both. My development background is in Python and Java and I've dabbled with C, C# and MySQL. 
### [Ashley Szelag](https://github.com/aeSzelag)
I am working through my last year as a Public Safety Administration and Data Science and Analytics double major, focusing on math, computer science, and network security courses. I specialize in data related skills with an interest in Python. In my spare time I enjoy campimg with my family and learning new skills, so I'm excited for the potential of this program. I'm excited to acquire and hone the skills involved with this project.
