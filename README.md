It's goal is to make it easier to find and compare campgrounds that match the user's specified criteria across a number of providers. It will return a list of campgrounds that match the users preferences and display information about them. Additionally, it will provide a provision for users to submit information about campgrounds to maintain the accuracy of it's campground data as well as to review campgrounds to help other users inform their selections.

I am in my second semester as a computer science masters student at Eastern Michigan University. I enjoy both the outdoors and building solutions with technology and look forward to working on this project which will combine both. My development background is in Python and Java and I've dabbled with C, C# and MySQL.
